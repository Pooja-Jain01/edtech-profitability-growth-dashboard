# EdTech Profitability Growth Dashboard

## 1. Business Problem
Management could not clearly identify which courses were driving profit vs just revenue volume. The goal was to analyze course-level profitability and marketing efficiency.

## 2. Data Source
The dataset was structured in Excel to simulate real EdTech operations, including:
- Course Name
- Revenue
- Marketing Cost
- Enrollment Count
- Operational Cost

Data was cleaned and modeled before importing into Power BI.

## 3. KPIs Used
1. Net Profit = Revenue - Total Cost  
2. Net Profit Margin % = Net Profit / Revenue  
3. Cost per Enrollment = Marketing Cost / Enrollment  

These KPIs were selected to evaluate profitability, efficiency, and scalability.

## 4. Key Insights
- A small group of courses generated most of the total profit.
- Some high-enrollment courses had low margins.
- Marketing spend was inefficient for certain low-profit courses.

## 5. Business Recommendations
- Scale marketing for high-margin courses.
- Optimize or reprice low-margin high-volume courses.
- Reallocate budget to protect profitability.

## 6. Tools Used
- Excel (Data Modeling)
- Power BI (Dashboard & Visualization)
